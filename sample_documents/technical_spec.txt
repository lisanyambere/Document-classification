System Architecture for Document Classification Pipeline

1. OVERVIEW
This specification outlines the technical implementation of an advanced document classification system utilizing both traditional machine learning algorithms and large language model architectures for intelligent document routing and analysis.

2. ALGORITHM SPECIFICATIONS
Primary Classifier: Gradient Boosting with TF-IDF feature engineering
- Accuracy: >98% on benchmark datasets
- Processing time: <50ms per document
- Feature dimensions: 1000+ TF-IDF features + categorical features

Secondary Classifier: Transformer-based LLM with attention mechanisms
- Model: GROQ API with Moonshot AI architecture
- Context window: 2000+ characters with intelligent sampling
- Processing time: 500-1000ms per document
- Reasoning capabilities: Advanced contextual understanding

3. ROUTING ALGORITHM
Adaptive threshold management with LLM-based reasoning:
- Heuristic features: word count, technical density, formatting complexity
- ML confidence prediction using lightweight gradient boosting
- LLM reasoning for uncertain cases (confidence 0.4-0.7 range)
- Dynamic load balancing based on system performance metrics

4. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
Architecture Components:
- FastFeatureExtractor: Sub-3ms feature extraction
- MLConfidencePredictor: Lightweight model for routing decisions  
- AdaptiveThresholdManager: Dynamic threshold adjustment
- SupervisoryAgent: Main orchestration component

Performance Requirements:
- Throughput: >1000 documents/minute in production
- Accuracy: >95% across all document categories
- Latency: <200ms average end-to-end processing
- Cost efficiency: <$0.01 per document classification

5. RESILIENCE PATTERNS
Error handling and fallback mechanisms:
- Circuit breaker patterns for API failures
- Graceful degradation to ML-only mode
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

This system provides enterprise-grade document classification with intelligent routing between fast traditional ML and accurate LLM analysis based on document complexity and business requirements.
